# Knights-Tour
Repo for our ECE 551 project (Fall 2024)

## NOTES
- ONLY PUSH CODE THAT WORKS (PASSES TESTBENCHES)
- ONLY ADD Verilog files (.sv, .v), Quartus files (.qpf, .qps), and Synthesis files. None of those extra back up files.
- If it's successfully run on the FPGA, tag folder with FPGA_passed
